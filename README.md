â€œO Deep Thought computer," he said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us...." he paused, "The Answer." <br>
"The Answer?" said Deep Thought. "The Answer to what?"<br>
"Life!" urged Fook.<br>
"The Universe!" said Lunkwill.<br>
"Everything!" they said in chorus.<br>
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection.<br>
"Tricky," he said finally.<br>
"But can you do it?"<br>
Again, a significant pause.<br>
"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it."<br>
"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement.<br>
"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it."
